1. Analyze your Vector implementation,  what is the Big-O of each function.  Why?
2. Analyze your Doubly Linked List implementation, what is the Big-O of each function.  Why?
3. Write a function using a doubly linked list to return the index of the nth odd number from the tail of the list (think back to the arrays exercise asking the same thing)
4. Implement a Vector class, where the `this.storage = new DoublyLinkedList()` instead of array like before
5. Analyze again the Big-O of all the fuctions of the new Vector class using doubly linked list, what is the big-O,why?

Learning Objectives:

1. To understand how different data structures can solve the same purpose
2. To understand how using different data structures effects the complexit (Big-O)
3. To make sure that you understand how to use the Doubly Linked List in practice

Reason Why:

 * In interviews, you might have to mix and match data structures so I want you comfortable with it
